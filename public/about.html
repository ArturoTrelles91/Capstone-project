    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate developer with a strong technical background in programming, data analysis, and computational optimization. My experience spans languages such as Python, C, and JavaScript, and I am currently focusing on backend development using Node.js, Express, and SQL databases. My interest in data science and astronomy has led me to collaborate on international projects like DESI and LSST, where I applied advanced machine learning techniques to explore large volumes of astronomical data. I am always looking to improve the efficiency and scalability of systems through optimization and parallelization. Solving complex problems creatively is my drive, and I continuously seek to learn new technologies and face technical challenges in multidisciplinary teams.
